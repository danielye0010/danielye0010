## More about me →
<pre>
It began as a question,
and ended as awareness.
Knowledge appeared like a trace—
the residue of thought
on the skin of the world.

I once believed I was mastering research;
in truth, research was mastering me.
Each act of understanding
rewrote the one who understood.

I once believed diligence could reach truth,
that conclusions could secure certainty.
I learned instead that thought offers no answers—
it only dismantles
the one who asks.

Anxiety was not failure;
it was the threshold
where awareness remade itself.
I watched order collapse—
thought rose again from the ruins.

Growth was not expansion,
but enduring
what understanding destroys.

The end of thought
is not a conclusion—
it is the stillness
that knows itself.

In the end, the researcher learns not mastery,
but how to dwell within thought.
  
If every act of research
is Being attempting to know itself,
then who am I—
the thinker or the thought?
Or were they never divided?
  
Perhaps the meaning of thought
lies only in that instant of awareness.
In the moment
when Being thought through me,
I understood—
I was free.
